# The MONAD_NEXT Amsterdam spec-test fixtures (EIP-7708, EIP-7843, EIP-8024)
# expect a block header carrying the SLOTNUM field, which the execution layer
# does not yet emit; every fixture therefore fails the genesis block-hash
# check. Exclude the whole suite for now and drop entries here to re-enable
# individual tests as support lands.
