// This example program works with two different kinds of events rings:
//
//   1. "Live" event rings -- these are a source of real-time data. In the
//      case of an event ring containing execution events, the Category Labs
//      execution daemon is writing EVM event notifications into them in
//      real time
//
//   2. "Snapshot" event rings -- these are compressed snapshots taken
//      of an event ring file as it existed at a particular moment in
//      time; they implicitly "rewind" to the first event in the queue
//      and to replay a fixed set of historical execution events. Snapshots
//      are useful for testing and development workflows, because you do not
//      need to be running an active monad node to use them
//
// Using either kind of ring is largely the same, but there are some
// important differences. Because a snapshot is an "offline" image of
// historical events, it (1) can never gap and (2) as soon as it replays
// all of it events, there can't be any more.
//
// A live event ring is more complex, since it needs to be polled
// moment-to-moment, and there are some classic inter-process communication
// complexities (you need some kind of a "timeout" mechanism to detect when
// the execution process appears to be dead or hung).

    // The event ring shared memory data structure typically lives inside
    // of a regular file; any process that wants shared access to it, first
    // locates it via the filesystem, then maps a shared view of it into the
    // process' virtual memory map using the mmap(2) system call.
    //
    // Most real-time programs take a path to the event ring file as a CLI
    // input parameter, but also allow it to be absent, in which case the
    // default file name is used.
    //
    // Event ring files can be located anywhere, but there is a performance
    // benefit to placing them on a hugetlbfs in-memory filesystem; the function
    // EventRingPath::resolve will turn "pure" file names (i.e., those with no
    // '/' character in the path) into a full path located in a special
    // directory on a hugetlbfs filesystem, e.g., `my-ring` will be translated
    // into `<hugetlbfs-root>/my-ring`. Any path that already contains a path
    // separator character, e.g., `./my-ring`, will be not be modified.

    // through the automatic path expansion rules for "pure" filenames, so
    // that the application writers do not need to understand all the logic
    // for how the hugetlbfs path location works. The functions that open
    // event rings take an "EventRingPath" instead of a PathBuf to ensure
