# RISC-V cross toolchain

Builds the `riscv64-none-elf` GCC used to cross-compile the zkVM guest
(`zkvm/guest`). CI consumes this from `docker/Dockerfile`; the same output
works locally.

Flakes are not enabled in a stock Nix install. Either add

```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`, or pass
`--extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes"` to each `nix` command
below, as `docker/Dockerfile` does.

```shell
nix build ./nix#toolchainEnv
cmake -B build-zkvm -S zkvm/guest \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$PWD/category/core/toolchains/riscv64-elf.cmake \
    -DRISCV_TOOLCHAIN_DIR=$PWD/result \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

## Why nix

`riscv-gnu-toolchain` builds by cloning binutils, gdb and newlib from
sourceware.org, which rate limits (HTTP 429) and has made cold builds fail
outright. nixpkgs fetches hash-pinned source tarballs from its own CDN
instead, so a cold build depends only on `cache.nixos.org`.

A cold build takes roughly 8 minutes on 16 cores. Only stage-1 GCC, newlib
and the final GCC are compiled; everything else, cross binutils included, is
substituted from `cache.nixos.org`. That is cheap enough that no additional
binary cache is needed — the docker layer cache absorbs the common case, and
a miss costs minutes rather than the tens of minutes a full
`riscv-gnu-toolchain` bootstrap would.

## Pinning

`flake.lock` pins nixpkgs. The pin is chosen so GCC is **15.2.0**, matching
both the Ubuntu host `gcc-15` and the GCC that `riscv-gnu-toolchain`
2026.05.06 built. Keeping the cross and host compilers in lockstep is
deliberate; check it after bumping:

```shell
nix build ./nix#toolchainEnv
./result/bin/riscv64-none-elf-gcc -dumpfullversion   # must match gcc-15 -dumpfullversion
nix flake update --flake ./nix                       # to bump
```

## Soft float

The stock `pkgsCross.riscv64-embedded` target is `lp64d` (hard float), which
the zkVM's no-FPU environment cannot use. `riscv64-toolchain.nix` declares
`rv64ima` / `lp64` explicitly so newlib is rebuilt for that ABI too. Verify
with:

```shell
./result/bin/riscv64-none-elf-readelf -h <obj> | grep Flags   # 0x0, not 0x4
```
