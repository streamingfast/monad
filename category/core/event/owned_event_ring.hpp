/// This is done so that our object lifetime will hold open the BSD-style
/// advisory exclusive file lock (see flock(2)) that we assume the caller has
/// already placed on the file. That lock marks the event ring as "owned" to
/// other processes; another aspect of the ownership contract is that the class
/// destructor will also unlink the file at `ring_path` from the filesystem
